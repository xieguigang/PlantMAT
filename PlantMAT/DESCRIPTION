Description: Custom software entitled Plant Metabolite Annotation Toolbox (PlantMAT) 
has been developed to address the number one grand challenge in metabolomics, which 
is the large-scale and confident identification of metabolites. PlantMAT uses informed 
phytochemical knowledge for the prediction of plant natural products such as saponins 
and glycosylated flavonoids through combinatorial enumeration of aglycone, glycosyl, 
and acyl subunits.
