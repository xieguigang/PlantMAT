Sample Data for PlantMAT v1.0
-----------------------------
Notes & Instructions [1Oct16]
=============================

This folder contains two sample datasets for the demonstration of PlantMAT:

1. Folder 'A17_Aerial': ESI-MS and MS/MS data of metabolites from aerial extracts of Medicago truncatula (A17)
	- metabolite_list.txt	List of metabolites in TXT [Peak_No	Precursor_m/z]
	- Peak_No.txt		MS/MS data (centroid line) for each peak in TXT [Fragment_m/z	Fragment_int]

2. Folder 'A17_Root': ESI-MS and MS/MS data of metabolites from root extracts of Medicago truncatula (A17)
	- metabolite_list.txt	List of metabolites in TXT [Peak_No	Precursor_m/z]
	- Peak_No.txt		MS/MS data (centroid line) for each peak in TXT [Fragment_m/z	Fragment_int]

All above data were generated from UHPLC-ESI-QTof-MS/MS analyses. Please refer to our publication for the sample information and experimental conditions. Please also read quickstart guide on how to use PlantMAT.
